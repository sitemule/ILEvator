</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP</b></td><td>Protocol plain HTTP</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_ACCEPTED</b></td><td>The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating
the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where another process or
server handles the request, or for batch processing.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_ALREADY_REPORTED</b></td><td>Used inside a &amp;lt;dav:propstat&amp;gt; response element to avoid repeatedly enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY</b></td><td>This error response means that the server, while working as a gateway to get a response needed to handle the request, got an invalid response.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_BAD_REQUEST</b></td><td>The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_CONFLICT</b></td><td>This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_CREATED</b></td><td>The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result. This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_EXPECTATION_FAILED</b></td><td>This response code means the expectation indicated by the Expect request header field can&#39;t be met by the server.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_FAILED_DEPENDENCY</b></td><td>The request failed due to failure of a previous request.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_FORBIDDEN</b></td><td>The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource.
Unlike 401, the client&#39;s identity is known to the server.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT</b></td><td>This error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_GONE</b></td><td>This response is sent when the requested content has been permanently deleted from server, with no forwarding address. Clients are expected to remove their
caches and links to the resource. The HTTP specification intends this status
code to be used for &#34;limited-time, promotional services&#34;. APIs should not feel
compelled to indicate resources that have been deleted with this status code.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_IM_USED</b></td><td>The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied
to the current instance.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE</b></td><td>The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR</b></td><td>The server has encountered a situation it doesn&#39;t know how to handle.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_LENGTH_REQUIRED</b></td><td>Server rejected the request because the Content-Length header field is not defined and the server requires it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_LOCKED</b></td><td>The resource that is being accessed is locked.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_LOOP_DETECTED</b></td><td>The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED</b></td><td>The request method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used. For example, an API may forbid DELETE-ing a resource. The two mandatory
methods, GET and HEAD, must never be disabled and should not return this error
code.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_MISDIRECTED_REQUEST</b></td><td>The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for
the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_MULTI_STATUS</b></td><td>Conveys information about multiple resources, for situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_NETWORK_AUTH_REQUIRED</b></td><td>The 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_NO_CONTENT</b></td><td>There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_NON_AUTHORITIVE_INFO</b></td><td>This response code means the returned meta-information is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a
third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource.
Except for that specific case, the &#34;200 OK&#34; response is preferred to this status.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE</b></td><td>This response is sent when the web server, after performing server-driven content negotiation, doesn&#39;t find any content that conforms to the criteria
given by the user agent.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_NOT_EXTENDED</b></td><td>Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfil it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_NOT_FOUND</b></td><td>The server can not find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is
valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this
response instead of 403 to hide the existence of a resource from an
unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most famous one due
to its frequent occurrence on the web.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED</b></td><td>The request method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled. The only methods that servers are required to support (and therefore that
must not return this code) are GET and HEAD.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_OK</b></td><td>The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method: &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_PARTIAL_CONTENT</b></td><td>This response code is used when the Range header is sent from the client to request only part of a resource.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE</b></td><td>Request entity is larger than limits defined by server; the server might close the connection or return an Retry-After header field.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_PAYMENT_REQUIRED</b></td><td>This response code is reserved for future use. The initial aim for creating this code was using it for digital payment systems, however this status code
is used very rarely and no standard convention exists.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_PRECONDITION_FAILED</b></td><td>The client has indicated preconditions in its headers which the server does not meet.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_PRECONDITION_REQUIRED</b></td><td>The origin server requires the request to be conditional. This response is intended to prevent the &#39;lost update&#39; problem, where a client GETs a
resource&#39;s state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile
a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_PROXY_AUTH_REQUIRED</b></td><td>This is similar to 401 but authentication is needed to be done by a proxy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE</b></td><td>The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large. The request may be resubmitted after reducing the size of the
request header fields.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b></td><td>This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client. It means that the server would like to shut
down this unused connection. This response is used much more since some
browsers, like Chrome, Firefox 27+, or IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms
to speed up surfing. Also note that some servers merely shut down the
connection without sending this message.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LONG</b></td><td>The URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_REQUESTED_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE</b></td><td>The range specified by the Range header field in the request can&#39;t be fulfilled; it&#39;s possible that the range is outside the size of the target
URI&#39;s data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_RESET_CONTENT</b></td><td>Tells the user-agent to reset the document which sent this request.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE</b></td><td>The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded. Note that together with
this response, a user-friendly page explaining the problem should be sent.
This responses should be used for temporary conditions and the Retry-After:
HTTP header should, if possible, contain the estimated time before the
recovery of the service. The webmaster must also take care about the
caching-related headers that are sent along with this response, as these
temporary condition responses should usually not be cached.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_TEAPOT</b></td><td>The server refuses the attempt to brew coffee with a teapot.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_TOO_EARLY</b></td><td>Indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS</b></td><td>The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (&#34;rate limiting&#34;).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED</b></td><td>Although the HTTP standard specifies &#34;unauthorized&#34;, semantically this response means &#34;unauthenticated&#34;. That is, the client must authenticate itself to get
the requested response.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_UNAVAILABLE_FOR_LEGAL_REASONS</b></td><td>The user-agent requested a resource that cannot legally be provided, such as a web page censored by a government.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY</b></td><td>The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE</b></td><td>The media format of the requested data is not supported by the server, so the server is rejecting the request.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_UPGRADE_REQUIRED</b></td><td>The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.
The server sends an Upgrade header in a 426 response to indicate the required
protocol(s).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_VARIANT_ALSO_NEGOTIATES</b></td><td>The server has an internal configuration error: the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself, and is
therefore not a proper end point in the negotiation process.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_HTTP_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED</b></td><td>The HTTP version used in the request is not supported by the server.</td>
</tr>

will be split to a length of 80 characters.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_MULTIPART_ENCODING_BINARY</b></td><td>Binary part encoding : The content will be added to the part as is.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="iledocs-table-key-column"><b>IV_MULTIPART_ENCODING_TEXT</b></td><td>Text part encoding : The content will be added as text encoded in the specified CCSID (see Content-Type HTTP header, attribute charset). This corresponds to the Content-Transfer-Encoding
8bit.</td>
